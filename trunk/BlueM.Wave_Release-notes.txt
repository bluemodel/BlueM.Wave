BlueM.Wave Release Notes
===============================================================
Version 1.6.2
-------------
NEW:
* Added write support for ZRXP format
* Added write support for UVF format
* Added write support for SYDRO binary format (BIN) (only in x86 version)
* Added a button for visualizing NaN values of the currently active series
* Added metadata handling for time series, metadata is displayed in the series properties dialog
* Implemented reading and writing of metadata for file formats UVF and ZRXP
* Added a dialog for editing metadata before export
* Added a new analysis function "Cumulative" which converts a time series to cumulative values
* Added the possibility of specifying custom import settings in Wave project files (*.wvp) (#720)
* Added a button and a dialog for merging time series (#719)
* Added a dialog for specifying a reference date (beginning of simulation) when importing HYDRO_AS-2D files
* The Open File menu now includes a list of recently used files (not stored across sessions)
* Added a button for changing the time step of a time series (#717) (only in x86 version)
* Added the ability to process more clipboard contents from TALSIM 
  (including BIN files and multiple files/series at once) (#695)
* Added the ability to extract WEL files from WLZIP files of the same name
CHANGED:
* The "Remove error values" function has been changed to "Convert error values" and now converts 
  user-specified error values to NaN
FIXED:
* The Reload from Files command now respects the previously made series selection for each file
* Imported files are no longer kept as file objects in memory (should lead to less memory usage)
* ZRXP format: the time part of the timestamp is now optional (00:00:00 assumed if missing)
* ZRXP format: values equal to the error value specified as "RINVAL" in the file header are 
  converted to NaN during import
* UVF format: fixed reading and writing of time series starting before 1900
* UVF format: values equal to -777 are assumed to be error values and converted to NaN during import
* BIN format: values equal to -9999.999 are recognized as error values and converted to NaN during import
* Fixed export to SMUSI REG format. Time series must be equidistant with 5 minute time step.
API-CHANGES:
* The function TimeSeries.getCleanZRE() has been replaced with two separate functions:
  Timeseries.removeNaNValues() and Timeseries.convertErrorValues()

Version 1.6.1
-------------
NEW:
* Added support for loading and saving Wave project files (*.wvp) (#705)
* Added a button for displaying time series properties in a table view (#711)
* Added the ability to load TALSIM simulation results using the clipboard (by pressing Ctrl+V) (#695)
* Added an "AnnualStatistics" analysis function which calculates statistics such as
  min, max, avg and volume of a time series for each hydrological year
* The "Comparison" analysis function now fits a simple linear regression line to the data
  (using the Math.NET Numerics library)
* The analysis function Histogram now allows the user to specify the bins (#397). 
  Also, the histogram result data is now written to the log.
* The analysis function MonthlyStatistics now writes the result data to the log
* Added a button for removing user-specified error values from series
* Added a button for renaming series
* Added a dropdown button for zooming to a specific series
* Added support for exporting series to CSV format (#318)
* Added support for importing files in the ZRXP format (*.zrx)
* GoodnessOfFit (GoF) analysis function:
  * Added "Logarithmic Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency" as a new GoF parameter
  * The GoF parameters can now optionally be calculated for individual hydrological years
* Added support for importing BW_TMP.DAT result files from HYDRO_AS-2D
CHANGED:
* Error values in time series such as e.g. -777 and -9999 are now imported and displayed as regular values.
  Previously, when importing from BIN and DWD-T-L format, these would be replaced with NaN.
  The new "Remove error values" function can be used to remove these error values, if desired. (#693)
* Analysis GoodnessOfFit: Volume error is based on actual volume integrated over time 
  if the time series unit ends with "/s"
* Removed support for the DWD-T-L format
* If a time series contains duplicate nodes, the duplicate nodes are now simply discarded 
  and a warning is written to the log instead of aborting the import
FIXED:
* The decimal mark selector in the import series dialog now actually works (#351)
* Comparison analysis function: changed the result series to a point series because a line series automatically 
  sorts itself by the x-values and thus connects the points in the wrong order (not time-based)

Version 1.6
-----------
NEW:
* Significantly improved the possibilities for viewing and navigating time series:
  - New toolbar buttons for zooming, panning, zoom undo and zoom all
  - Start and end date for display can be set using date/time pickers
  - Display range can be set to exact date/time ranges using a simple interface
  - Buttons for navigating in time using a user-specified time increment
  - All changes to the viewport are recorded in a history that can be undone

Version 1.5
-----------
NEW:
* Support for importing GISMO files
* Support for importing HYDRO-AS_2D files
* Support for importing UVF files
* Support for importing SYDRO binary files (x86 version only)
* Support for loading TeeChart themes (*.xml) 
* The date format can now be specified while importing time series (#686)
CHANGED:
* Loading a TEN-file does not cause existing series to be deleted, 
  the series contained in the TEN-file can be imported optionally
* More options for cutting time series (cut all series at once and keep original series)
* Small improvements to layout and functionality
* Switched to .NET Framework 3.5
REMOVED:
* RVA files no longer supported
