  all other series have a default interpretation value of 99 (Undefined).
  Series with interpretation 2 (BlockRight), 3 (BlockLeft) and 5 (CumulativePerTimestep)

  (including BIN files and multiple files/series at once) (BUG 695)
* Added the ability to extract WEL files from WLZIP files of the same name
CHANGED:
* The "Enter time series" dialog has been improved, unparseable values are now converted to NaN 
  instead of causing an abort of the import.
* The "Remove error values" function has been changed to "Convert error values" and now converts 
  user-specified error values to NaN
* When importing time series from SMUSI REG format, the title is taken from the first line of the file, 
  before any comma
FIXED:
* The Reload from Files command now respects the previously made series selection for each file
* Imported files are no longer kept as file objects in memory (should lead to less memory usage)
* ZRXP format: the time part of the timestamp is now optional (00:00:00 assumed if missing)
* ZRXP format: values equal to the error value specified as "RINVAL" in the file header are 
  converted to NaN during import
* UVF format: fixed reading and writing of time series starting before 1900
* UVF format: values equal to -777 are recognized as error values and converted to NaN during import
* BIN format: values equal to -9999.999 are recognized as error values and converted to NaN during import
* Fixed export to SMUSI REG format. Time series must be equidistant with 5 minute time step.
API-CHANGES:
* The function TimeSeries.getCleanZRE() has been replaced with two separate functions:
  Timeseries.removeNaNValues() and Timeseries.convertErrorValues()
KNOWN ISSUES:
* When saving a chart to the native TEN format of TeeChart, any NaN values contained in the series are lost 
  (i.e. the nodes with the NaN values are omitted from the series).

Version 1.6.1
-------------
NEW:
* Added support for loading and saving Wave project files (*.wvp) (BUG 705)
* Added a button for displaying time series properties in a table view (BUG 711)

* Added support for importing BW_TMP.DAT result files from HYDRO_AS-2D
CHANGED:
* Error values in time series such as e.g. -777 and -9999 are now imported and displayed as regular values.
  Previously, when importing from BIN and DWD-T-L format, these would be replaced with NaN.
  The new "Remove error values" function can be used to remove these error values, if desired. (BUG 693)
* Analysis GoodnessOfFit: Volume error is based on actual volume integrated over time 
  if the time series unit ends with "/s"
* Removed support for the DWD-T-L format
* If a time series contains duplicate nodes, the duplicate nodes are now simply discarded 
  and a warning is written to the log instead of aborting the import
FIXED:
* The decimal mark selector in the import series dialog now actually works (BUG 351)
* Comparison analysis function: changed the result series to a point series because a line series automatically 
  sorts itself by the x-values and thus connects the points in the wrong order (not time-based)

* Small improvements to layout and functionality
* Switched to .NET Framework 3.5
REMOVED:
